ARTH-MOVING MACHINE TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

1. Hydraulic System Issues
Symptom: Hydraulic system slow, jerky, or no movement
Possible Causes:

Low hydraulic fluid level
Clogged hydraulic filter
Air trapped in hydraulic lines
Worn hydraulic pump
Damaged control valve spool

Remedies:

Check and refill hydraulic fluid to recommended level
Clean or replace hydraulic filter
Bleed air from hydraulic system
Test pump pressure; repair or replace pump if below spec
Inspect control valve; clean or replace if spool is sticking


2. Engine Overheating
Symptom: Engine temperature rises rapidly or warning light ON
Possible Causes:

Coolant level low
Radiator clogged with dirt/debris
Faulty thermostat stuck closed
Water pump failure
Fan belt loose or broken

Remedies:

Refill coolant and check for leaks
Clean radiator fins and flush cooling system
Replace thermostat
Inspect water pump for impeller damage; replace if faulty
Tighten or replace fan belt


3. Tracks or Wheels Not Moving
Symptom: Machine does not propel forward or reverse
Possible Causes:

Drive motor failure
Hydraulic pump malfunction
Control valve stuck
Track tension too loose
Final drive gear damage

Remedies:

Inspect and replace drive motor if seized
Test hydraulic pump pressure; repair or replace
Clean or replace control valve
Adjust track tension to OEM specification
Inspect final drive gears; replace if worn or broken


4. Electrical System Malfunction
Symptom: No power to lights, sensors, or control panel
Possible Causes:

Battery discharged or dead
Loose wiring connections
Blown fuse or relay failure
Corroded terminals
Alternator not charging

Remedies:

Recharge or replace battery
Tighten and secure all wiring connections
Replace blown fuse and check circuit for short
Clean corroded terminals and apply dielectric grease
Test alternator output; replace if defective


5. Fuel System Problems
Symptom: Engine cranks but does not start or runs rough
Possible Causes:

Fuel filter clogged
Air in fuel line
Faulty fuel pump
Injector nozzle clogged
Water contamination in fuel

Remedies:

Replace fuel filter
Bleed fuel system to remove air
Test fuel pump pressure; replace if below spec
Clean or replace injector nozzles
Drain fuel tank and refill with clean fuel


6. Excessive Smoke from Exhaust
Symptom: Black, blue, or white smoke from exhaust
Possible Causes:

Black smoke: Over-fueling, clogged air filter
Blue smoke: Engine oil entering combustion chamber
White smoke: Coolant leak into cylinders

Remedies:

Replace air filter and check fuel injection settings
Inspect piston rings and valve seals; replace if worn
Pressure test cooling system; repair head gasket if leaking


7. Warning Lights or Error Codes
Symptom: Dashboard shows fault codes or warning lights
Possible Causes:

Sensor malfunction (temperature, pressure, speed)
Loose sensor connectors
ECU software error
Short circuit in wiring harness

Remedies:

Scan ECU for error codes using diagnostic tool
Check and secure sensor connectors
Update ECU software if available
Inspect wiring harness for damage; repair or replace


8. Poor Machine Performance
Symptom: Low digging force, slow cycle times
Possible Causes:

Hydraulic pump wear
Incorrect engine RPM
Blocked hydraulic lines
Worn bucket teeth or cutting edge

Remedies:

Test pump flow and pressure; replace if worn
Adjust engine RPM to recommended range
Flush hydraulic lines and remove blockages
Replace worn bucket teeth or cutting edge


Safety Note:
Always park the machine on level ground, engage parking brake, shut off engine, and relieve hydraulic pressure before troubleshooting.
